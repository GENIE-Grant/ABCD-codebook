# Anthropometric Variables

Anthropometric variables were collected and/or reported at several time points during development.

## Body Mass Index (BMI)

### Scoring

For scoring purposes, all raw variables are included in cleaned data (renamed to follow appropriate naming conventions), along with derived variables which compute BMIz scores based on 2000 WHO reference data for all time points (including self-reported data). A 'best available' BMI (and accompanying BMIz score) within the past year at target ages 11.0, 14.0, 16.0, and 18.0 is also calculated. This 'best available' BMI data uses clinic data when available and self/parent-report data if clinic data is not available. This approach is used to maximize accuracy and coverage of data when BMI at a specified age is to be used for eating disorder diagnosis and/or employed as an analytic predictor.
